# Current Status

## What Works
- ✅ Local HTTP server running on port 3000
- ✅ Three.js 3D viewer with orbit controls
- ✅ Code editor (textarea version in simple.html)
- ✅ Downloaded OpenSCAD WASM files (9.2MB openscad.wasm + worker)
- ✅ UI styling and layout

## Current Issue

The OpenSCAD worker from ochafik.com/openscad2 has complex dependencies:
- Requires BrowserFS for virtual filesystem
- Uses a webpack-bundled worker
- Has specific initialization sequence

The worker is throwing errors because it expects a specific environment setup that matches the original openscad-playground project.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use OpenSCAD Playground's Full Setup (Complex)
This would require:
1. Cloning the entire openscad-playground repo
2. Running their build process
3. Using their compiled output

### Option 2: Simplify to Basic Rendering (Recommended)
Create a simpler proof-of-concept that:
- Uses a JavaScript-based CAD library (OpenJSCAD)
- Has full module support
- Works without complex WASM setup
- Can be enhanced to native OpenSCAD later

### Option 3: Build OpenSCAD WASM from Source
- Clone https://github.com/DSchroer/openscad-wasm
- Build with Docker/Deno
- Use the compiled output
- Most control but most complex

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:

1. **Create working version with OpenJSCAD** - JavaScript implementation with module support (works immediately)
2. **Debug the current WASM setup** - Try to fix the worker dependencies
3. **Build from source** - Set up the full OpenSCAD WASM build process

The easiest path forward is Option 1 - using OpenJSCAD which supports modules and will work right now.
